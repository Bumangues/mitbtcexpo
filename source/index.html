Given the potential impact of cryptocurrency on society it is imperative for us, as witnesses to its birth, to nurture and cultivate further investigation into its uses. The MIT Bitcoin Expo is a student-run conference that aims to create a dynamic space for the exploration of cryptocurrency and facilitate networking between present and future hackers, entrepreneurs, and policy makers.
